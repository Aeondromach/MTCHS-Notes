# Notes
Notes should be readable in Github, as they are markdown, but they are typed using [Obsidian Notes](https://obsidian.md) so they may be formatted weirdly on Github.
## LaTex
anything encased in "\$" or "\$\$" will need a LaTex reader to easily read. I recommend [This one](https://arachnoid.com/latex/), or just use [Obsidian Notes](https://obsidian.md).
## Images
Images will only be able to be read in a cloned vault, or in a separate vault with the 'Excalidraw' plugin installed. Separate PNG folder is provided with all Excalidraw images.
