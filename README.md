# Notes
Notes should be readable in github, as they are markdown, but they are typed using (Obsidian Notes)[https://obsidian.md] so they may be formatted weirdly on github.
## LaTex
anything encased in "$" or "$$" will need a LaTex reader to easily read. I recommend (This one)[https://arachnoid.com/latex/], or just use (Obsidian Notes)[https://obsidian.md].
