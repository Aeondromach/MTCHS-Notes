If $f$ has a local extrema within its domain (excluding endpoints) at a point $c$, then $f^1(c)=0$.
![[First Derivative THM example 0 Picture 1]]
# Critical ~~Friends~~ Point
An interior point on the domain of $f$ where $f^1$ is undefined or zero.
# Finding Absolute Extrema
*Also works for finding any extrema*
1. Find all critical points and end points of $f$.
2. Then we teste all of these values to find the largest and smallest.
#### Example
Find the absolute max and min of $f(x)=x^2$ on $[-2,1]$.
	End points: -2, 1
