Concavity is the direction a function opens.
Given the differentiable function y=f(x):
1. $f(x)$ is concave up when $f^1(x)$ is increasing.
2. $f(x)$ is concave down when $f^1(x)$ is decreasing.
# Second Derivative Test for Concavity
Let $f(x)$ be a twice differentiable function on the interval $I$.
1. If $f^{11}(x)>0$, then $f(x)$ is concave up on $I$.
2. If $f^{11}(x)<0$, then $f(x)$ is concave down.
When $f^{11}(x)=0$ or $\nexists$, this is an inflection point. $f(x)$ changes concavity.
