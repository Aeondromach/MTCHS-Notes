If $f(x)$ is continuous over the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable at every point on the interior $(a,b)$, then if $f(a)=f(b)$ $\exists$ at least one number $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that $f^1(c)=0$.

Suppose $f(x)$ id contininuous on$[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$. Then there is at least one point $c$ in $(a,b)$ where
