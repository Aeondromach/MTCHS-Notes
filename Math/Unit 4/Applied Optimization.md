#### Example
Find the dimensions of a cylindrical can that uses the least material.
1. Read the Problem
	- List given information
	- List relevant equations
	- Determine what is being optimized
	Given:
	- Can is cylindrical
	- Can is 1 liter
	Optimizing:
	- Surface Area
	Equations:
	- SA of cylinder $=2\pi r^2+2\pi rh$
	- Vol of cylinder $=\pi r^2h$
