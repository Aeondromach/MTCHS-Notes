If $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then there exists a value $c$, where $a<c<b$ such that $f(c)$ is between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.
#### Example
Determine if there is a value $c$, such that $f(c)=1$, when $f(x)=x$ on $[0,2]$
$f(a)=f(0)=0$
$f(b)=f(2)=2$

$f(0)<f(c)<f(2)$
$0<1<2$
Since $f(x)=x$ is continuous on $[0,2]$, and $f(0)<f(c)<f(2)$, then by the IVT there exists a $c$, such that $0<c<2$.
#### Example
If $f(x)=x^2$ is continuous on $[-1,1]$, does there exist a $c$, such that $f(c)=4$.
$f(a)=f(-1)=1$
$f(b)=f(1)=1$
