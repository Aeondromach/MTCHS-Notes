$f^1(x)=\frac{d}{dx}f(x)=\frac{d_y}{d_x}$ 

$f^1(x)$
the $1^{st}$ derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$.

$\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$
"$D$ over $d_x^{-1}$ derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$." $(d,dx)$

$\frac{d_y}{d_x}$
$y=f(x)$

---
For a function $f(x)$ to be differentiable at a point, it must be continuous at that point. For a function to be differential on it's entire domain, $f(x)$ must have a derivative at each point in the domain.

## THM
Differentiability implies continuity.
	If $f(x)$ has a derivative at $x=c$ (i.e. $f^1(c)$ exists), then $f$ is continuous at $c$.
	
### Points on a function that are not differentiable.
1. **Corners:** A sharp turn in a function (like a 90$\degree$ angle)
2.
