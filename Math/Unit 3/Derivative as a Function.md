$f^1(x)=\frac{d}{dx}f(x)=\frac{d_y}{d_x}$ 

$f^1(x)$
the $1^{st}$ derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$.

$\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$
"$D$ over $d_x^{-1}$ derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$." $(d,dx)$

$\frac{d_y}{d_x}$
$y=f(x)$

---
For a function $f(x)$ to be differentiable at a point, it must be continuous at that point. For a function to be differential on it's entire domain, $f(x)$ must have a derivative at each point in the domain.
