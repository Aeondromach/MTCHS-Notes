#### Examples
##### Water is filling a conical tank at a rate of 9ft$^3/$min. The tank is inverted such that the base is towards the sky with a height of 10ft and a base radius of 5ft. How fast is the water rising when the water is 6ft deep?

$\frac{dv}{dt}=9\text{ft}^3/\text{min}$
$y=6ft$
$V=\frac{1}{3}\pi x^2y$

$\frac{5}{10}=\frac{x}{y}$
$\frac{y}{2}=x$
$V=\frac{1}{3}\pi(\frac{y}{2})^2y$
$V=\frac{\pi}{3}*\frac{y^2}
