$$\int^{b}_{a}f(x)dx$$
- b = Upper Bound
- a = Lower Bound
- $\int$ = integral sign
- $f(x)$ = function to be integrated
- $dx$ = variable that is being integrated

## Formal Definition
$$\int^{b}_{a}f(x)dx=\lim\limits_{n \rightarrow \infty}\sum^{n}_{k=1}f(a+k\frac{b-a}{n})(\frac{b-a}{n})$$

> - Integrals represent accumulated change
> - Integrals are the area under a curve
