$A(x)=\pi(R(x))^2$
$V=\int^b_x(\pi(R(x))^2)dx$
#### Example
Find the volume of the solid generated by rotating the region between the curve $y=\sqrt{x}$, $0\leq x\leq4$, and the x-axis about the line $y=0$

> $$V=\int^4_0\pi(\sqrt{x})^2dx$$$$V=\int^4_0\pi x dx$$$$V=\frac{\pi x^2}{2}|^4_0=8\pi$$
#### Example
Find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by $y=\sqrt{x}$ and the lines $y=1$, $x=4$ about the line $y=1$.
