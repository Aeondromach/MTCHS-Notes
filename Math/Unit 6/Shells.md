# Volume by Shells
The volume of the solid generated by revolving the region between the x-axis and the graph of the cont. function $y=f(x)\geq 0$, $L\leq a\leq x \leq b$ about a vertical line $x=L$.
$$V=\int^b_a 2\pi(\text{shell radius})(\text{shell height})dx$$
#### Example
Find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the region enclosed by the x-axis and $y=3x-x^2$ about the vertical line $x=-1$.
