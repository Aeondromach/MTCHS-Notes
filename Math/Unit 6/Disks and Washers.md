# Calculating the volume of a solid
1. Sketch the solid and a cross section.
2. Find the formula of a typical cross section. $A(x)$
3. Find bounds of integration
4. Integrate $A(x)$ to find volume.
#### Example
A pyramid $3m$ high has a square base that is $3m$ on a side. the cross section of the pyramid perpendicular to the altitude $xm$ down from the vertex is a square $xm$ on a side. Find the volume of the pyramid.
