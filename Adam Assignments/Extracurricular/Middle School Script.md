## Future plan
### College
- Currently plan on attending Boise State University
- Plan on Dual majoring in GIMM (Games, Interactive Media, & Mobile Technology) and Computer Science
- MTCHS makes dual majoring much easier as I am currently already enrolled into Computer Science, so by the time I go to college, I will already be halfway done with one of my majors
- Because of MTCHS both giving college credits through normal classes, but also giving advanced opportunities, I will be finishing college in about half the time that someone else would take, for example, I am slated to finish college the same year as my sister, who is 23, and 2 years into college already.
### Internships and future jobs
- I plan on getting a job in either game design or game development in the near future, preferably over this summer actually, As once I complete this year of highschool, I will be entering the workforce, in the form as our internship.
- MTCHS provides us the means of obtaining an in-person, 280 hour internship, which will show our experience, and professionalism to other employers.
- I myself plan on taking my internship over this summer, while also taking a couple of college classes, as I want to make sure my future is secure.
- After Highschool, I'll want to get a job, and mixing all of my certifications, early college credits, and already obtained experience, I will be set and ready to take a well off job pretty right much out of highschool.
### My own ambitions
- I have ambitions of making my own gaming studio, and producing my own games, free from outside pressure and influences
- With the help of
