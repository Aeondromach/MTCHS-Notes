# Future Opportunities
## Plans for this year
### Video Game Competition
- Skills USA
- Competition is April 7
- Competing against everyone in the state
- talk a little about the game maybe?
### Robotics Competition
- Planning on going for state
- Preparing for our first competition in December
### Collecting college credits like candy
- CS121, Java and object oriented code, finishing next month
- Business 2, preparing for business
- Calculus 1, math but hard
- Conceptual Physics
#### Next Year
- CS221
- Calculus 2
- *Others?*
## Future plan
### College
- Currently plan on attending Boise State University
- Plan on Dual majoring in GIMM (Games, Interactive Media, & Mobile Technology) and Computer Science
- MTCHS makes dual majoring much easier as I am currently already enrolled into Computer Science, so by the time I go to college, I will already be halfway done with one of my majors
- Because of MTCHS both giving college credits through normal classes, but also giving advanced opportunities, I will be finishing college in about half the time that someone else would take, for example, I am slated to finish college the same year as my sister, who is 23, and 2 years into college already.
### Internships and future jobs
- I plan on getting a job in either game design or game development in the near future, preferably over this summer actually, As once I complete this year of high school, I will be entering the workforce, in the form as our internship.
- MTCHS provides us the means of obtaining an in-person, 280 hour internship, which will show our experience, and professionalism to other employers.
- I myself plan on taking my internship over this summer, while also taking a couple of college classes, as I want to make sure my future is secure.
- After Highschool, I'll want to get a job, and mixing all of my certifications, early college credits, and already obtained experience, I will be set and ready to take a well off job pretty right much out of high school.
### My own ambitions
- I have ambitions of making my own gaming studio, and producing my own games, free from outside pressure and influences
- With the help of teachers, namely Mr. Erickson, my computer science teacher, and Mrs. Heesch, my Business teacher, I have learned what is necessary to start this studio, and have already began work to get it started.
- With the computer skills I have learned, I am able to make my own website, and produce all of the content I need, for free, as I can make it myself, and don't need to pay too much to get it custom made.
- All in all, everything my teachers have taught me has provided me the perfect skills to follow my own dreams and ambitions, and my future in this industry has been made very secure, thanks to MTCHS, but moreover, the absolutely amazing teachers who helped me every step of the way, and still help me now.

# Actual Script
Hello, everyone! Today, I’m excited to share why I chose to attend MTCHS and how it’s transformed my journey in technology.

I chose MTCHS because I’ve always been fascinated by technology. My dream has been to become a game developer, and MTCHS offered specific opportunities I couldn’t find elsewhere. It’s also a great school for students with potential who maybe haven’t had perfect grades. MTCHS was exactly what I needed, with unique programs and resources, especially in cybersecurity.

When I started here, I had almost no experience in programming, and my grades were pretty average. My work ethic wasn’t the best, but I had drive and ambition. For example, I didn’t even know what HTML was until 9th grade! Despite my lack of experience, I was eager to learn and take advantage of what MTCHS offered.

Since coming here, I’ve made huge strides. I’m now one of the top students in my class in programming, almost maintaining a 4.0 GPA, and my work ethic has improved significantly. My drive and ambition have only grown as I’ve gained more skills. I’ve become so comfortable with HTML that I even make websites for fun now, and I often help classmates and even teachers with tech and coding issues.

I’ve also been part of VEX Robotics since 8th grade, which has taught me how to work with a team, manage roles, and understand my strengths and weaknesses. By sophomore year, I was even able to lead a team, learning valuable skills in time management and collaboration.

Through MTCHS, I also took the Game Design course in Advanced Technical Training during my freshman year, where I became certified in Unity. This opened up a whole new world, as I learned about other game engines, setting me up with valuable skills for game development.

Looking forward, I have some exciting plans. I’m participating in a statewide game design competition with Skills USA in April, where I’ll showcase my game design skills. And, of course, I’m preparing for our first robotics competition in December. I’m also earning college credits by taking classes like CS121, Java, Business 2, Calculus, and Physics, and I plan to continue with more advanced classes next year.

After MTCHS, I plan to attend Boise State University and dual major in GIMM (Games, Interactive Media, & Mobile Technology) and Computer Science. Thanks to MTCHS, I’ll already have a solid foundation in computer science, allowing me to finish college in record time. In fact, I’ll be on track to finish at the same time as my sister, who’s 23 and already two years into college!

Beyond college, I’m hoping to work in game design or development right after high school, ideally through the internship MTCHS requires us to complete. This 280-hour, hands-on internship will give me professional experience that most high school students never get.

Ultimately, my dream is to start my own game studio, producing games free from outside influences. Thanks to my teachers, especially Mr. Erickson and Mrs. Heesch, I’ve learned so much about what it takes to start a business, and I’m already laying the groundwork. With my skills in web design, programming, and business, I feel well-prepared to chase my dreams confidently.

In conclusion, MTCHS and my teachers have given me the tools I need to follow my ambitions, and I am incredibly grateful for that. Thank you all for listening!
