A flat isosceles right-triangular plate with base $6ft$ and height $3ft$ is submerged vertically base up, $2ft$ below the surface of a pool. Find the force exerted by the water against one side of the plate.

$$F=\int^b_a w*(\text{strip depth})*(L(y)~dy$$
$w=62.4$
$a=0$
$b=3$
$\text{strip depth}=5-y$
$L(y)=2y$
$$F=\int^3_0(62.4)(5-y)(2y)~dy$$
$$F=124.8\int^3_0 5y-y^2~dy$$
$$F=1684.8~lbs$$
