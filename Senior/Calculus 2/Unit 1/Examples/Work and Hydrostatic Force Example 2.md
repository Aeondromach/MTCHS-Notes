A $5lb$ bucket is lifted from the ground by pulling $20ft$ of rope at a constant speed. The rope weighs $.08\frac{lb}{ft}$. How much work was required to lift the bucket?
![[Work and Hydrostatic Force Example 2 Picture 1.excalidraw]]
$$F(x)=(.08)(20-x)~\leftarrow~\text{Force of rope after being lifted x feet}$$
$$F(x)=5~\leftarrow~\text{force of bucket}$$
$$W=\int^20_0 (.08)(20-x)+5~dx$$
$$W=\int^20_0 1.6-.08x+5~dx$$
$$W=\int^20_0 6.6-.08x~dx$$
$$W=6.6x-0.4x^2|^20_0$$
$$W=116ft-lb$$
