Given a tank that is shaped like an inverted cone with a height of $10ft$ and base radius of $5$. If the tank is filled with olive oil (weighing $57\frac{lbs}{ft^3}$) to $2$ feet from the top, how much work is required to pump the oil to the rim of the tank (empty the tank)?
> height: $10ft$
> radius: $5$
> tank weight: $57\frac{lbs}{ft^3}$
> height top top: $2ft$

$$\frac{5}{10}=\frac{r}{x}=>\frac{x}{2}=r$$
$$V=\pi(\frac{x}{2})^2\delta x$$
$$F(x)~\text{weight}=V*\rho~\text{density}=$$
